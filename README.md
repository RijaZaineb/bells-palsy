# Bell's Palsy Treatment Effectiveness Analysis

### Objectives

- Assess short-term (3-month) and long-term (9-month) recovery outcomes across treatment groups.
- Quantify the effectiveness of Prednisolone and Acyclovir in comparison to placebo treatments.
- Identify factors influencing delayed recovery and provide actionable insights.

### Key Insights

#### Short-Term Effectiveness: 
Prednisolone-based treatments showed significant improvements at 3 months, with moderate practical significance.
#### Long-Term Convergence: 
Recovery outcomes across groups became more similar at 9 months, with smaller effect sizes.
#### Treatment Timing Matters: 
Earlier treatment start correlated with better recovery outcomes.

### Technologies

#### Python (Pandas, SciPy): 
Conducted data cleaning, statistical tests (ANOVA, pairwise t-tests), and effect size calculations.
#### Visualization Tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn): 
Created visualizations such as box plots and annotated bar charts to present results.

### Potential Business Value

Inform clinical decision-making by highlighting the most effective treatment protocols for Bellâ€™s Palsy.
Optimize resource allocation for early intervention strategies to improve recovery outcomes.
Support further research and trials by identifying key factors influencing patient recovery.

### Future Enhancements
Develop a predictive model to forecast recovery outcomes based on treatment type, patient demographics, and clinical factors, providing additional insights for personalized treatment strategies.

This project demonstrates proficiency in leveraging statistical analysis and visualization tools to extract actionable insights from clinical trial data
